# Eye-Movement-Exercise
MIT assignment
Description of project: This was an assignment for week 8 of the MIT Pro Fullstack developer certificate program. It is a javascript exercise to create two eyes on the middle of the page that follow your mouse. Other than creating the second eye, I also changed the background color in the code.
How to Run: Just load into your browser and move your mouse:)
